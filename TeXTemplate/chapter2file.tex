%\section{Some background } 
%
%In order to study the trunk of the elephant, my best beloved, we have so many stories to tell you~\cite{kipling2010just}. 
%
%Assume that the trunk consists of $N$ different segments. On the other hand, it is always important to cite the crucial work in the field~\cite{willems2007there}.

Cartoon elephants require special cleverness and a deep knowledge of cartoon physics to measure with motion capture technology.}
