%%%% We believe this template now meets the style requirements for a PHD 
%%% dissertation at Tufts University, but you still need to check this with
%%% the Tufts University graduate handbook, currently located at 
%%% http://asegrad.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/GraduateStudentHandbook.pdf
%%% starting at page 25 to make sure your final document is in compliance.

%%% This file contains a template that can be used with the package
%%% utthesis.sty and LaTeX2e to produce a thesis that meets the requirements
%%% of the Graduate School of The University of Texas at Austin.
%%%
%%% All of the commands defined by utthesis.sty have default values (see
%%% the file utthesis.sty for these values).  Thus, theoretically, you
%%% don't need to define values for any of them; you can run this file
%%% through LaTeX2e and produce an acceptable thesis, without any text.
%%% However, you probably want to set at least some of the macros (like
%%% \thesisauthor).  In that case, replace "..." with appropriate values,
%%% and uncomment the line (by removing the leading %'s).
